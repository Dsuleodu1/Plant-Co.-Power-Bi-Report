# PowerBI-Sales-Report

A Power BI perfomance report using several unique visualizations of Plant Co. sales data from years prior to date to the current year to date. We grab our bottom 10 countries in our statistical data and we compare gross profit, quantity, and sales from 2022 to 2024. With this data we cross examine product types such as; indoor, landscape, outdoor, and values prior year to date. Lastly we look for profitability seperation using a scatterplot chart to help see the wide spread distributions keying in on trend lines to find combined averages.

> This is the completed visualization output of our PowerBI Perfromance report. The image shows you how much sales and GP% have dropped from the prior year to date stats of 2022 to the current year to date stats that we are comparing in 2023. We can look at our charts for monthly decreases and see how in the year of 2023 there was very little positive profit net through out all of the countries. Though our gross profit percentages dropped a few points we can look at the account profitability seperation and see that our average trend line is still on target with majority of people having close to around a 40% GP%. Lastly what we can make from this chart is that there are several determining factors that can make drastic changes to our outputs but from our analaysis product type, location and date time seem to play the biggest role in determining sales or gross profit.
